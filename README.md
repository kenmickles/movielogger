movielogger
=============
Silly little web app to log movies you watch to Tumblr. Input a movie name and it'll create a Tumblr video post with a YouTube video of the trailer and a link to the Wikipedia page about the film.

To setup:
-------------------
Update config.ini with your own settings. You'll need a [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) account and a [Yahoo API key](http://developer.yahoo.com/).


Why would you want to do this?
-------------------------------
OCD, mostly. Also for stuff like this:
